Story Safe Wiki is a unique wiki platform designed to enhance the user experience for fans of various narratives. This wiki platform allows users to set their preferred spoiler level. By setting a spoiler level users that haven't read the entire story can freely explore the content up to the point that they have read without having to worry about the rest of the story being spoiled. As an open source project we want to encourage people to use our platform to start up wiki's for whatever story they want. Our spoiler level system is number based and allows you to wrap any content in a spoiler tag based on the number associated with whatever point in the story you want.
